# PixL renderer
This is a toy renderer I made with C++ and OpenGL to play with graphics.


## Compiling & Running
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [xmake](https://xmake.io/)
2. Run the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/Pixfri/PixLRenderer
xmake b TestApplication
```

The binaries should be in the directory named using the following pattern : `build/{mode}-{os}-{architecture}/TestApplication/bin`.

To run the application from your terminal, you can simply run this command : `xmake run TestApplication`
